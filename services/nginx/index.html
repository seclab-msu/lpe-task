<h2> WTF </h2>
The goal is to read flags from C:\ of the windows machine (see <a href='https://drive.solidlab.ru/sharing/zodn2G9CL'>OVA File</a>):
<ul>
    <li> C:\flag_warmup.txt : 100 points </li>
    <li> C:\flag_cve_easy.txt : 300 points</li>
    <li> C:\flag_cve_hard.txt : 600 points</li>
</ul>
After looking at the OVA file and figuring out how you can read those files from a non-admin account, 
you'll need to create a windows x64 executable that automates the attack. NB: the password for user and admin accounts in the OVA is P@ssw0rd1234.<br>
The passwords are changed in the real machine, as well as flag file contents. Other than that the real machine is idential to the OVA above.<br>
Your binary will be executed as user "user" and given 3 minutes of running time.<br>
You'll be able to see the output once the binary is executed (Use the check button below and the UUID you got when submitting).<br>
The machine is reset to a snapshot before each run, so your exploit will need to do everything in one go.<br>
Please do not submit too many executables - the execution queue is shared by all participants and has limited capabilities (10-15 minutes per submission, because the VM needs to boot every time)<br>
The /submit is rate-limited to 1 request per IP per minute, if you submit more frequently, you'll get HTTP 503. In this case, just wait a little and retry <br>
If a submission is in "IN_PROGRESS" state for a long time (say, 20 minutes), please report to @webpentest.<br>
